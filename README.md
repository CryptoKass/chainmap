# 🗺️ ChainMap

ChainMap provides a comprehensive map of EVM blockchain networks and their associated data. It includes information such as chain IDs, network names, RPC URLs, and currency details.

```ts
import chainMap from "chainmap";
import { JsonRpcProvider, formatUnits } from "ethers";

const ethereum = chainMap.ethereum.mainnet;
const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(ethereum.rpc[0]);
```

## Features

- 🗺️ A Comprehensive map of blockchain networks.
- 📝 Includes chain IDs, network names, image assets, RPC URLs, and currency details.
- ⚡️ Free RPC URLs for each network.
- 📅 Built daily to ensure RPCs are working.

## Installation

You can install ChainMap using npm/yarn/bun:

```bash
npm install chainmap
```

## Usage

Get a specific networks data.

```ts
import chainMap from "chainmap";

chainMap.ethereum.mainnet.rpc; // <- an array of free RPC URLs
chainMap.ethereum.mainnet.chainId; // <- the chain ID e.g. "1"
chainMap.ethereum.mainnet.name; // <- the network name e.g. "Ethereum Mainnet"
chainMap.ethereum.mainnet.currency; // <- the currency details e.g. { name: "Ether", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 }
chainMap.ethereum.mainnet.explorerUrl; // <- the explorer URL e.g. "https://etherscan.io"
```

Get a network by its chain ID.

```ts
import chainMap from "chainmap";

const ethereumInfo = chainMap[1]
ethereumInfo.rpc; // <- an array of free RPC URLs
... // etc
```

## Contributing

Chainmap source files are generated from specifications in `data` directory. During the generation process, rpcs are tested to ensure they are working. If a network fails to connect, it is removed from the generated source files.

### ✏️ Modify a network

Open the network data file `data/<network>.list.ts`, and make your modifications, ensuring the
default exported Object still confroms to the `ChainMap` interface.

### ➕ Add a network

Create a new file in the `data` directory, named `<network>.list.ts`. The file should export an object that conforms to the `ChainMap` interface.

e.g. Creating a new network called `mychain` with chain ID `1234` and RPC URL `https://mychain.com`:

```ts
import { ChainMap } from "./types";

export const MYC {
  name: "MyCoin",
  symbol: "MYC",
  decimals: 18,
  }

export default {
  mainnet: {
    chainId: 1234,
    name: "MyChain mainnet",
    currency: MYC,
    explorerUrl: "https://mychain.com",
    rpc: [
      "https://rpc.mychain.com",
      "https://rpc2.mychain.com",
    ],
  },
} as ChainMap; // <- ensures the object conforms to the ChainMap interface
```

## Generate and build

Typically source files should be generated by the github action, but you can generate them locally using bun.

**Prerequisites:**

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

```bash
bun run generate
```

You can then build the distribution files:

```bash
bun run build
```

### Testing networks

You can check that all network RPCs are working by running:

```bash
bun test
```
